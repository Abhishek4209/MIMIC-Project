He was also noted to be jaundiced with asterixis.  Pt had also sustained a fall with facial trauma several weeks ago.   In the ED, he desaturated to 80% on 6L/NC and was found to have EKG evidence of an acute anterior MI.  He was intubated for airway protection & seen by cardiology.  He had an emergent ECHO which demonstrated an EF of 40-50%.  He was felt to be too high risk for anticoagulation or catheterization, and was treated medically with beta-blocker, aspirin, and plavix.  He also received a chest CTA to evaluate a widened mediastinum & LLL consolidation prior to transfer to MICU.

There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 50%). The distal anterior septum and a portion of the apex appear hypokinetic. The right ventricular size and function appear normal. [**2149-8-1**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.  Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There is no evidence of endocarditis.  Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2149-7-30**], there has been no significant change. [**2149-7-30**] CXR - Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation. [**2149-7-30**] Chest CT - Left lower lobe consolidation and patchy opacities seen in the remaining left lung consistent with infectious process.  No aortic dissection. [**2149-7-30**] Abd CT - Cirrhotic liver with TIPS stent. Splenomegaly.  New enhancing nodular foci within the right lobe of the liver at the dome and surrounding the previous site of RF ablation, most compatible with local multifocal recurrence. [**2149-7-30**] Head CT - No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. [**2149-7-31**] TIPS U/S - Reduced overall rate of flow through the tips compared with previous exam, at which time flow was approximately 80-85 cm per second. Flow across the TIPS is now uniformly approximately 40-45 cm per second. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 5715**] was admitted via the ED on [**2149-7-30**] following presentation with mental status changes & subsequent respiratory failure.  He was intubated & transferred to MICU upon admission.  In addition to his end-stage liver failure & hepatic encephalopathy, he was also found to have a LLL pneumonia & a new ST-elvation MI.  He was not a candidate for cardiac cath or anticoagulation, so his MI was treated medically with beta-blocker/asa & initially plavix, which was later stopped. He remained intubated & mechanically ventilated while his pneumonia was treated with antibiotics (cipro/vanco).  Pt discovered to also have enterococcus/staph UTI sensitive to current antibiotics.  Neurology consulted on [**8-4**] for question of seizure like activity with rhythmic eye & arm movements - clinically diagnosed with status epilepticus, bedside EEG with delta slowing, low amplitude waves.  Based on his poor progress and poor prognosis, following a discussion [**2149-8-5**] with the patient's mother & partner, the focus of care was shifted to comfort measures only (based on previously expressed wishes), the patient was eventually extubated, and expired at 17:40 PM on [**2149-8-5**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5716**].
